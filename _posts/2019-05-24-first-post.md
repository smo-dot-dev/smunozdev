The Bed of Procrustes
* The best revenge on a liar is to convince him that you believe what he said.
* When we want to do something while unconsciously certain to fail, we seek advice so we can blame someone else for the failure.
* It is harder to say no when you really mean it than when you don't.
* Never say no twice if you mean it.
* Your reputation is harmed the most by what you say to defend it.
* The only objective definition of aging is when a person starts In talk about aging.
